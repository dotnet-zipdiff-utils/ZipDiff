{"name":"ZipDiff.NET","tagline":"Utility for comparing the contents of 2 different zip files","body":"# ZipDiff\r\n\r\nUse the ZipDiff tool when you need to compare the contents of two zip files.\r\n\r\nRun it as a standalone executable. The tool supports four output formats: plain text, XML, HTML and ZIP (containing differences).\r\n\r\nThis version of ZipDiff has been ported from Java to C# (.NET)\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nTo get a copy of Zipdiff you have the following options:\r\n\r\n* Download the source and run the `build.cmd` (which runs an MSBuild against `build.proj`)\r\n* Install using NuGet. Your options are:\r\n  * [ZipDiff](https://nuget.org/packages/ZipDiff/) - the command-line utility\r\n  * [ZipDiff.Core](https://nuget.org/packages/ZipDiff.Core/) - the class-library (to use in your own applications)\r\n* or finally, you can download the executable directly from my DropBox share: [zipdiff.exe](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3504568/Projects/OSS/ZipDiff/zipdiff.exe)\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nTo use ZipDiff you will need to have the [.NET Framework 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/download/details.aspx?id=17851) installed.\r\n\r\n## Command line arguments\r\n\r\n\tzipdiff.exe --file1 foo.zip --file2 bar.zip [--options]\r\n\r\nValid options are:\r\n\r\n\t--comparecrcvalues            Compares the crc values instead of the file content\r\n\t--comparetimestamps           Compares timestamps instead of file content\r\n\t--outputfile                  Name of the output file\r\n\t--exitwitherrorondifference   Use an error code other than 0, if differences have been detected\r\n\t--regex                       Regular expression to match files to exclude\r\n\t--verbose                     Print detail messages\r\n\r\n## Output formats\r\n\r\nWhen using the `--outputfile` option, the following formats are available:\r\n\r\n* Plain-Text\r\n* HTML\r\n* XML\r\n* Zip (containing the differences between `--file1` and `--file2`)\r\n\r\nFor example, to output a zip file:\r\n\r\n\tzipdiff.exe --file1 foo.zip --file2 bar.zip --outputfile diff.zip\r\n\r\nIf the output file extension can not be determined, then the format will default to a plain-text file.\r\n\r\n## References\r\nThis version can be found at https://github.com/leekelleher/ZipDiff.NET\r\n\r\nThe original [zipdiff](http://zipdiff.sourceforge.net/) project was developed by Sean C. Sullivan and James Stewart.\r\n\r\nA fork (with enhancements) was recently made by [Hendrik Brummermann](https://github.com/nhnb).
